Hello-world



Hello, on the other side of the mirror.


Programming has been around for a while now. 
I am tempted to do this because I want to use it to convert my knowledge. 
I want to create programs based on knowledge and sociological, 
philosophical and cybernetic theories. 
If I can help in this area, I would like to communicate. 
My strengths are quality information theory, system theory by Niklas Luhmann,
sociological cybernetics, meta cybernetics, Information theory of everything, 
symbiotic theory, the theory of language, and much more.
For more than 10 years he has been dealing with social issues, 
discovering many important mechanisms of functioning of social, 
religious, political, economic and psychic systems.
So I guess when I know the problem,
that I will be able it perfectly broke down into solution.
